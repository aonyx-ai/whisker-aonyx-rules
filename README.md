# whisker-aonyx-rules

Aonyx's lint rules for [whisker][whisker]. These are the rules that enforce
the conventions in Aonyx's `CLAUDE.md` files: the ones Clippy does not
cover, like derive ordering, wildcard match arms, and imports written inside
function bodies.

Whisker ships no rules of its own. A project that wants these runs them by
naming this repository and a commit:

```toml
# .config/whisker.toml
[[lints]]
git = "https://github.com/aonyx-ai/whisker-aonyx-rules"
rev = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
```

Whisker fetches that commit, builds every rule in it, and loads them. The
revision is written out in full and no branch or tag is accepted, so a check
runs the same rules today and next month.

## The rules

Each directory under `lints/` is one rule, and each documents itself. The
rule ids they report under are all `lint.<name>`.

## Pinning

A rule is a `cdylib` that whisker loads into its own process. Rust has no
stable ABI, so whisker refuses any plugin that was not built by the same
rustc from the same whisker source as the binary doing the loading. Three
things therefore move together:

- The `rev` in this repository's `Cargo.toml`, which every rule builds
  against. `just pin` prints it.
- `rust-toolchain.toml`, which must match whisker's.
- The `rev` that a project names in its own `.config/whisker.toml`, which
  should be a commit of this repository built against the whisker that
  project runs.

To bump: move the three `rev` values in `[workspace.dependencies]` to the
new whisker commit, copy whisker's `rust-toolchain.toml` over this one, run
`cargo update -w`, and let CI's dogfood job confirm the pair still loads. A
mismatch is a refusal with an error naming what to rebuild, never a silent
wrong answer.

## Adding a rule

Copy the smallest existing rule, `lints/no_todo_comments`, and change the
name in its `Cargo.toml`, its rule id, and its logic. A rule implements the
generated `RustLintPass` trait, returns diagnostics with a stable rule id
and a severity, and hands itself to `export_lints!`. Rules that read
semantic decorations **fail open**: when the decoration is missing, the rule
stays silent rather than guessing.

Every rule has tests beside it, and `just test` runs all of them. `just
check-self <path-to-whisker>` checks this repository with the rules in it.
